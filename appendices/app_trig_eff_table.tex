\section{Trigger efficiency}
\label{app:trig_eff}
The trigger efficiency of all $Z'$ signal MC samples is shown in Table~\ref{table:m_trig_eff_mumu}. It is evident that at low $Z'$ mass ($\sim$100 GeV), the combined trigger efficiency of the signal MC sample is significantly reduced because the typical $p_{T}$ of the signal leptons is lower than the $p_{T}$ threshold of the trigger.
