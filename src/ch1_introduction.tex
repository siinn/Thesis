\section{The Standard Model}
\label{sec:intro:standard_model}

The Standard Model (SM)~\cite{Burgess:2007zi} of particle physics has been the most successful theory in modern physics that describes the known fundamental particles and their interactions. The SM is a gauge theory based on $SU(3) \otimes SU(2) \otimes U(1)$ symmetry group. The symmetry group describes three fundamental interactions, quantum chromodynamics (QCD), quantum electrodynamics (QED), and weak interactions, which arises from the requirement of local gauge invariance. Gravity, the fourth fundamental interaction, is not incorporated in the SM because the gravitational force is much weaker than the electroweak or strong forces. All known matters are described by spin $\frac{1}{2}$ fermions, and the interactions between the fermions are mediated by spin 1 gauge bosons. Fermions acquire mass by interacting with the Higgs field $H$ via spontaneous symmetry breaking~\cite{Higgs:1964pj}.

\subsection{Fundamental Particles and Interactions}
\label{sec:intro:fundamental_particles}
The elementary particles in the SM can be divided into two groups, fermions and bosons.

Fermions are spin $\frac{1}{2}$ particles that constitute the building blocks of matter, and they can be divided into two groups, leptons and quarks, depending on the coupling to gluons. Leptons are colorless particles that do not interact through the strong force, and quarks are subject to the strong force due to color charges. There are three generations of leptons and quarks in increasing mass, and each generation consists of two leptons (electric charge 1 or 0) and two quarks (electric charge $\frac{2}{3}$ or $-\frac{1}{3}$). Quarks and charged leptons interact through the electroweak interaction while neutrinos only experience weak interaction. Fermions are described as quantum fields with \textit{left-handed} or \textit{right-handed} chirality, and only \textit{left-handed} fermions and \textit{right-handed} antifermions are subject to the weak interaction. This phenomenon is known as CP-violatoin~\cite{doi:10.1143}. Quarks are not observed as free particles due to \textit{color confinement}~\cite{SUGANUMA1995207}, but they are only observed in color-neutral bound states, called \textit{hadrons}. There are two types of hadrons: \textit{mesons} and \textit{baryons}. Mesons are composite particles with quark and anti-quark pair, and baryons are composed of three quarks. The elementary fermions are summarized in Table~\ref{table:elementary_fermions}.

The fundamental interactions are described by gauge bosons, spin 1 particles that are generated by the symmetry groups in the SM. Gluon fields are generated by $SU(3)$ group, and quanta of gluon fields produce massless gluons that mediate strong forces. The group $SU(2) \otimes U(1)$ generates gauge fields $W^{a}_{\mu}$ ($a$ = 1,2,3) and $B_{\mu}$ which mediate electroweak force. The physical observable gauge bosons $W^{\pm}$, $Z$, and photon are created by the mixing of these gauge fields as described in Eq.~\ref{eq:electroweak_mixing}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:electroweak_mixing}
\begin{split}
	W^{\pm}_{\mu} = (W^{1}_{\mu} \mp iW^{2}_{\mu}) / \sqrt{2} \\
	Z_{\mu} = \cos \theta_{W} W^{3}_{\mu} - \sin\theta_{W} B_{\mu} \\
	A_{\mu} = \sin \theta_{W} W^{3}_{\mu} + \cos\theta_{W} B_{\mu}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $\theta_{W}$ is the weak mixing angle.

Photon and gluons are massless, and $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons gain masses through the Higgs mechanism~\cite{PhysRevLett.13.508} via spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the Higgs mechanism, an additional complex scalar field, called Higgs field, is introduced with $SU(2)$ symmetry, and because the Higgs potential has non trivial vacuum expectation value, the symmetry of the ground state is spontaneously broken, leading to a massive scalar particle with spin 0, known as Higgs boson.

All elementary particle have associated anti-particles with the same property but with opposite charge. Therefore, neutral particles such as photon, $Z$, gluons and neutrinos are identical to its own anti-particles. The gauge bosons and their associated fields, and masses are summarized in Table~\ref{table:gauge_bosons}

\section{Beyond the Standard Model}
\label{sec:intro:bsm}

Although the SM has been the most successful theory at explaining fundamental particles and their interactions, there are several experimental observations and phenomena in nature that are not fully explained by the SM. These phenomena include gravity~\cite{PhysRevD.69.105009}, hierarchy problem~\cite{ARKANIHAMED1998263}~\cite{MAGG198061}, dark matter~\cite{navarro1996structure}~\cite{bertone2005particle}~\cite{clowe2006direct}, neutrino oscillations~\cite{ahn2003indications}~\cite{mikheev1985resonance}, and matter-antimatter asymmetry~\cite{toussaint1979matter}~\cite{dine2003origin}. 

Many Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) theories have been proposed to explain these unexplained phenomena, and they predict the existence of new particles. In particular, theories such as Hidden Valley~\cite{strassler2007echoes}~\cite{cassel2010electroweak}, R-parity violation~\cite{senjanovic1975exact}~\cite{mohapatra1981neutrino}, and $Z'$ models with neutrinos~\cite{Basso:2008iv} predict the existence of weakly-coupled, neutral gauge boson at the weak scale. The new gauge boson is called $Z'$ due to the similarity to the standard $Z$ boson. 

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$Z'$}{Z'} from the extension of the Standard Model}
\label{sec:intro:zprime_extension}

The new weakly-coupled gauge boson can be added to the SM by including a additional $U(1)'$ symmetry to the existing $SU(3) \otimes SU(2) \otimes U(1)$ symmetry. The spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)'$ symmetry, similar to the electroweak symmetry breaking, produces the new gauge boson, $Z'$~\cite{Langacker:2008yv}. The mechanism through which the new symmetry is added to the SM varies by theories. Nonetheless, the $Z'$ boson has two sets of parameters defining its property: the couplings to the SM particles and the energy scale at which the $U(1)'$ symmetry is broken. The former defines the lifetime, $c\tau$, of the particle while the latter defines the mass of the particle.

In one case, $Z'$ can have the same couplings to fermions as the SM $Z$ boson, and the particle is called \textit{sequential} $Z'$~\cite{BARGER1980377}. There have been several searches for the sequential $Z'$~\cite{PhysRevD.86.095010}~\cite{ABAZOV201188}~\cite{PhysRevD.90.052005}, and although the sequential $Z'$ provides useful reference for some theories, it will not be considered in this thesis as the main focus of the analysis is the long-lived particles.

In other case, the $Z'$ can have very small couplings to the SM particles such that the particle have a finite lifetime compatible with the detector volume at the ATLAS experiment. This metastable particle is called the \textit{long-lived} $Z'$, and this model will be used as a basis of this thesis.



\subsection{Long-lived \texorpdfstring{$Z'$}{Z'} Discovery Mode at the LHC}
\label{sec:intro:zprime_discovery}

The long-lived $Z'$ can be directly produced and discovered from $pp$ collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The primary discovery mode for the long-lived $Z'$ is via the Drell-Yan (DY) production of a dilepton resonance, $pp \rightarrow Z' \rightarrow  \ell^{+}\ell^{-}$ where $\ell= e$ or $\mu$~\cite{0034-4885-45-11-002}.

The cross section for $Z'$ decaying to two leptons ($pp \rightarrow Z' \rightarrow ell \bar{ell}$) is simply given by Eq.~\ref{eq:cross_section}~\cite{Langacker:2009su},

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cross_section}
\sigma^{ell}_{Z'} = \sigma_{Z'} B_{ell} = \frac{N_{ell}}{\mathcal{L}_{I}}
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_{Z'}$ is the production cross section of $Z'$, $B_{ell} = \Gamma_{f} / \Gamma_{Z'}$ is the branching ratio of $Z'$ into $ell\bar{ell}$, and $N_{ell}$ is the number of $ell\bar{ell}$ produced for integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L}_{I}$. Therefore, if $Z'$ is light enough to be produced at the LHC, the sensitivity to detect $Z'$ depends on luminosity, the production cross section, and the branching ratio into a particular channel.

Long-lived particles naturally have small width ($\tau_{0} = \hbar / \Gamma$), and the detectable mass range and lifetime of $Z'$ is constrained by the center of mass energy (13 TeV in Run II) and the detector volume ($\sim O(1m)$). 

Other potential discovery channels exist in searches for $Z'$ such as $Z' \rightarrow \tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ and hadronic decay, $Z' \rightarrow jj$ where $j =$ jet although these decay modes are more experimentally difficult to detect due to the irreducible QCD background. But the search for long-lived $Z'$ through a dilepton resonance is particularly interesting due to its clean final signature and low backgrounds from the SM.

More rare decays are also possible such as $Z' \rightarrow V f_{1} \bar{f}_{2}$ where $V = W, Z$ or $Z'$ decaying to two bosons, but these rare decays will be extremely difficult to detect due to the small branching ratio~\cite{Langacker:2009su}.
