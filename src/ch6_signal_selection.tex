\section{Event preselection}
\label{sec:selection:pre}


Event preselection is done in the reconstruction process in section.

In the first step of data reprocessing, events are selected by \texttt{DRAW\_RPVLL} filters as described in Section~\ref{sec:data_MC}. The filters are designed to select events of interest while maintaining reasonably low filter rates. Single photon ($\gamma$), single electron ($e$), di-photon ($\gamma\gamma$), di-electron ($ee$), and the combination of photon and electron ($e\gamma$) filters are used to select events with $ee$ or $e\mu$ candidates of interest. Single $\mu$ filter is used to select events with $\mu\mu$ or $e\mu$ candidates of interest.

Events are required to pass one of the HLTs listed in Table~\ref{table:triggers}. In order to increase the sensitivity to electrons and muons with large transverse and longitudinal impact parameters, $d_{0}$ and $z_{0}$, the triggers with no requirement on ID tracks are used. Consequently, muon trigger with Muon Spectrometer (MS) information only and photon triggers are used.

	Single muon                 & \texttt{HLT\_mu60\_0eta105\_msonly}   \\

  \caption{HLTs used to select events in \texttt{DRAW\_RPVLL} filter. Single photon trigger requires one photon with $p_{T} > 140$ GeV. Di-photon trigger requires two photons with $p_{T} > 50$ GeV. Single muon trigger requires one muon with $p_{T} > 60$ within $0 < |\eta| < 1.05$ using MS information only.}
  \label{table:triggers}
\end{table}

In addition to the HLT requirements, each filter requires offline selection on particles such as $p_{T}$, $\eta$, and $d_{0}$. Single photon ($\gamma$) or electron ($e$) filter requires a leading photon or electron, respectively, with $p_{T} > 150$ GeV, $\eta < 2.5$, and $d_{0} > 2.0$ mm. These filters also require a second photon or lepton with $p_{T} > 10$ GeV and $\eta < 2.5$ to keep the filter rate reasonably low. Single muon $\mu$ filter requires a muon with $p_{T} > 60$ GeV, $\eta < 2.5$, and $d_{0} > 1.5$ mm. Di-photon ($\gamma\gamma$), di-electron ($ee$), and the combination of photon and electron ($e\gamma$) filters require two photons/leptons with $p_{T} > 50$ GeV, $\eta < 2.5$, and $d_{0} > 2.0$ mm. The offline selection is summarized in Table~\ref{table:rpvll_filter_selection}.

The event selected by the \texttt{RPVLL} filters are passed downstream as \texttt{DRAW\_RPVLL} for the special track and vertex reconstruction.
