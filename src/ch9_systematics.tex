\chapter{Systematic Uncertainties}
\label{chap:syst}

The systematic uncertainties in the signal efficiency is computed by estimating the contribution of each efficiency factor in Eq.~\ref{eq:OverallEff} when possible. 

The systematic uncertainty in track and vertex reconstruction is studied using \Ks in Section~\ref{sec:syst:vertexing}. The systematic uncertainty in trigger is studied in Section~\ref{sec:syst:trigger} using tag-and-probe method with $Z\rightarrow \ee,\mumu$ events. %The systematic uncertainty in lepton reconstruction and identification cannot be estimated using data since no known particle exists in nature that has a long lifetime and mass larger than 10 GeV.



\section{Systematic Uncertainty in Track and Vertex Reconstruction}
\label{sec:syst:vertexing}

In a typical analysis, the systematic uncertainty in track and vertex reconstruction is estimated by the Inner Tracking Combined Performance group using the standard tracking setup. This result cannot be directly used for this analysis due to the special reconstruction setup described in Chapter~\ref{chap:reco}. Instead, the systematic uncertainty in track and vertex reconstruction is estimated by comparing vertex yields between the data and the MC samples using the process, $K_{S}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$. This process is ideal for comparing the efficiencies in the data and the MC samples due to the long lifetime ($c\tau \sim26.8~\si{\mm}$) of \Ks and the decay mode that leaves two charged tracks. However, there are intrinsic differences between \Ks and signal long-lived particles such as mass and $p_{T}$. In order to understand the validity and the limitation of this method, the kinematic distributions of \Ks and $Z'$ candidates are compared in Appendix~\ref{app:syst_Ks_Zp}.

Tracks originating from a \Ks decay can be reconstructed by either the standard tracking (ST) or the LRT algorithm, resulting in three categories of \Ks vertices: vertices with two \textit{standard tracks}, one standard track and one \textit{large-radius track}, and two large-radius tracks. \Ks vertex yields in each category can be expressed by total \Ks produced in a sample and tracking and vertexing efficiency,

\begin{align}
    N_{\mathrm{ST}}  &= K_{S}~\mathrm{produced} \times (\epsilon_{\mathrm{ST}})^{2} \cdot \epsilon_{\mathrm{vertexing~on~ST}}, \nonumber \\
    N_{\mathrm{ST+LRT}}  &= K_{S}~\mathrm{produced} \times (\epsilon_{\mathrm{ST}} \cdot \epsilon_{\mathrm{LRT}}) \cdot \epsilon_{\mathrm{vertexing~on~LRT}}, \nonumber \\
    N_{\mathrm{LRT}}&= K_{S}~\mathrm{produced} \times (\epsilon_{\mathrm{LRT}})^{2} \cdot \epsilon_{\mathrm{vertexing~on~LRT}},
\label{eq:Ks_eq1}
\end{align}
%
where $N$ represents vertex yields in each category. $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ST}}$ and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{LRT}}$ represent track reconstruction efficiency in the ST and the LRT, respectively. $\epsilon_{\mathrm{vertexing~on~ST}}$ and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{vertexing~on~LRT}}$ represents two-track vertex reconstruction efficiency on two standard or large-radius tracks, respectively.

In order to compare the efficiency in data and MC samples, the double ratio of data to MC is taken,
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{N_{\mathrm{LRT}} / N_{\mathrm{ST}}}{N_{\mathrm{LRT}}^{\mathrm{MC}} / N_{\mathrm{ST}}^{\mathrm{MC}}},
\label{eq:Ks_eq2}
\end{equation}
%
where quantities estimated using MC samples are denoted by MC, and quantities estimated using data are denoted otherwise. Using Eq.~\ref{eq:Ks_eq1} and the double ratio, the systematic uncertainty in track and vertex reconstruction is expressed as,

%\begin{align}
%    \dfrac{\dfrac{N_{LRT}}{N_{ST}}}{\dfrac{N'_{LRT}}{N'_{ST}}}  &= 
%        \dfrac
%        {\dfrac{(\epsilon_{\mathrm{LRT}})^{2} \cdot \epsilon_{\mathrm{vertexing~on~LRT}}}{(\epsilon_{\mathrm{ST}})^{2} \cdot \epsilon_{\mathrm{vertexing~on~ST}}}}
%        {\dfrac{(\epsilon'_{\mathrm{LRT}})^{2} \cdot \epsilon'_{\mathrm{vertexing~on~LRT}}}{(\epsilon'_{\mathrm{ST}})^{2} \cdot \epsilon'_{\mathrm{vertexing~on~ST}}}}
%\label{eq:Ks_eq2}
%\end{align}

\begin{align}
    \dfrac{N_{\mathrm{LRT}} / N_{\mathrm{ST}}}{N_{\mathrm{LRT}}^{\mathrm{MC}} / N_{\mathrm{ST}}^{\mathrm{MC}}} \cdot &=
    \dfrac{\dfrac{(\epsilon_{\mathrm{LRT}})^{2} \cdot \epsilon_{\mathrm{vertexing~on~LRT}}}{(\epsilon_{\mathrm{ST}})^{2} \cdot \epsilon_{\mathrm{vertexing~on~ST}}}}{\dfrac{(\epsilon_{\mathrm{LRT}}^{\mathrm{MC}})^{2} \cdot \epsilon_{\mathrm{vertexing~on~LRT}}^{\mathrm{MC}}}{(\epsilon_{\mathrm{ST}}^{\mathrm{MC}})^{2} \cdot \epsilon_{\mathrm{vertexing~on~ST}}^{\mathrm{MC}}}} 
    \\[10pt]
    \Big( \dfrac{\epsilon_{\mathrm{LRT}}}{\epsilon_{\mathrm{LRT}}^{\mathrm{MC}}}\Big)^{2} \cdot
    \Big( \dfrac{\epsilon_{\mathrm{vertexing~on~LRT}}}{\epsilon_{\mathrm{vertexing~on~LRT}}^{\mathrm{MC}}}\Big) &=
    \Big( \dfrac{N_{\mathrm{LRT}} \cdot N_{\mathrm{ST}}^{\mathrm{MC}}}{N_{\mathrm{LRT}}^{\mathrm{MC}} \cdot N_{\mathrm{ST}}} \Big) \cdot
    \Big( \dfrac{\epsilon_{\mathrm{ST}}}{\epsilon_{\mathrm{ST}}^{\mathrm{MC}}}\Big)^{2} \cdot
    \Big( \dfrac{\epsilon_{\mathrm{vertexing~on~ST}}}{\epsilon_{\mathrm{vertexing~on~ST}}^{\mathrm{MC}}}\Big).
\label{eq:Ks_eq3}
\end{align}

Events are selected using the same event selection described in Section~\ref{sec:selection:pre} except trigger filters as the high-$p_{T}$ photon or muon triggers are not suitable for \Ks study. From the selected events, \Ks candidates, referred as \Ks vertices, are selected by applying \Ks vertex selection to secondary vertices in the events. The \Ks vertex selection is similar to the $Z'$ signal vertex selection, but for consistency with \Ks study in Run I and background reduction, additional vertex cuts described in Ref.~\cite{Aad:2011hd} are applied. The mass window of 0.35 to 0.65 GeV is used in the \Ks vertex selection. The difference between \Ks and $Z'$ vertex selections are summarized in Table~\ref{table:ks_vertex_cut}. %Figure~\ref{fig:Ks_vertex_cutflow} shows \Ks vertex cut flow in the data and the background MC samples.

After applying the event and \Ks vertex selection, the \Ks vertex distributions are compared between the data and the MC samples in Figure~\ref{fig:Ks_data_MC}. The data sample is normalized to the MC samples which have limited statistics. Only \Ks vertices with two large-radius tracks are shown. The distributions show good agreement in the invariant mass, $p_{T}$, transverse, longitudinal position, and decay length of the vertices, except the pile-up distribution as expected.

\Ks vertices found in the data and the MC samples are binned in decay radius, $r$, and the \Ks yields in each bin are estimated after subtracting the background contributions using side-bands (350 - 450 GeV, 550 - 650 GeV) in invariant mass distribution. Figure~\ref{fig:Ks_mass} shows the mass distribution of \Ks vertex with two large-radius tracks from the data and the MC samples. The figure shows that backgrounds are small and uniform in the mass window, and the mass distributions are in good agreement between the data and the MC samples.

The vertex yields of \Ks with two large-radius tracks are compared between data and MC samples in Figure~\ref{fig:Ks_double_ratio}, where the data is normalized by a factor of $N_{\mathrm{ST}} / N_{\mathrm{ST}}^{\mathrm{MC}}$ where $N_{\mathrm{ST}}$ and $N_{\mathrm{ST}}^{\mathrm{MC}}$ are integrated over $r$. The ratio between two, representing the double ratio (Eq.~\ref{eq:Ks_eq2}), is shown in the lower pane.

In estimating the systematic uncertainty, largest discrepancies ($\sim0.95$, and $\sim1.05$), shown in the first and fourthbin, are taken as a conservative estimate of $(N_{\mathrm{LRT}} \cdot N_{\mathrm{ST}}^{\mathrm{MC}}) / (N_{\mathrm{LRT}}^{\mathrm{MC}} \cdot N_{\mathrm{ST}})$. The results from previous studies show that the systematic uncertainty in the standard tracking is $2\%$~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2015-051}, and the systematic uncertainty in secondary vertex reconstruction using standard tracks is $1\%$~\cite{Aaboud:2215485}. The study on secondary vertex reconstruction is performed using min-bias data, but relatively uniform distribution of efficiency as a function of pile-up (Figure~\ref{subfig:vertex_dist_mu}) suggests that this result is still applicable for data with $\langle \mu \rangle\approx$ 24. Using Eq.~\ref{eq:Ks_eq3} together with these results, the systematic uncertainty in track and vertex reconstruction in the LRT is estimated to be $10\%$.


%\subsection{Systematic uncertainty in Trigger Efficiency}
%\label{sec:syst_trigger}
%
%The efficiencies of all analysis triggers have been measured with tag-and-probe studies on data and MC as reported in Section~\ref{sec:trigger_efficiency}. Systematic uncertainties of tag-and-probe methods on the plateau efficiencies are usually of the order one percent and, therefore, negligible compared to other sources like tracking and vertexing. For this reason, no attempt was made to estimate systematic uncertainty in trigger efficiency.

\subsection{Systematic uncertainties on background estimations}
\label{sec:syst_bkg}

There are two main sources of background in this analysis; cosmic muon background and random crossing background. The cosmic muon background estimation is outlined in Section~\ref{sec:bkg:cosmic}. From this technique the estimate is $0.27 \pm 0.14 \textrm{ (stat.)}$ events. This $\pm 0.14$ is taken to be the total uncertainty on this background. In the case of the random crossing, there are two estimates event mixing and track flipping giving $2.40\times10^{-3}$ and $3.95 \times 10^{-3}$ respectively. For these the larger estimate of $3.95 \times 10^{-3}$ is used as the central value and the difference of $1.5\times10^{-3}$ is used as the uncertainty on this value.
