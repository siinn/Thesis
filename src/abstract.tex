A search for long-lived neutral massive particle decaying to a $\mu\mu$, $ee$, or $e\mu$ pair is presented using the ATLAS detector with 32.8 $\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV at the LHC. %No significant deviation from the Standard Model is observed.
Upper limits are presented on the production cross section times branching ratio for resonances decaying to a lepton pair. Also presented is the detection efficiency as a function of $p_{T}$ and $\eta$ for a resonance with mass of 0.1$-$2.0 TeV and lifetime ($c\tau$) of 100$-$500 mm to allow a theorist to set upper limit on the cross section for any model of interest.
