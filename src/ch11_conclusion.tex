A search for long-lived $Z'$ decaying to a $\mu\mu$, $ee$, or $e\mu$ pair is performed using 32.8 $\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. No events were observed, and the results are consistent with an expected background of 0.27$\pm$0.14 events. Upper limits are set on $\sigma \times$ BR for resonances decaying to a dilepton, and the resulting upper limits at the 95\% CL are 50 - 400 pb at $m_{Z'}=$ 100 GeV and 0.5-0.9 fb at $m_{Z'}=$ 1 TeV. %These upper limits exclude significant regions of the parameter space in search for long-lived particles.
Also presented is the signal efficiency as a function of $p_{T}$ and $\eta$ for resonances decaying to a dilepton with typical values of 10-20\% within the tracking coverage.
