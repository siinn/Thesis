  abstract={The Drell-Yan process is an electromagnetic effect in which a quark and antiquark from a pair of interacting hadrons annihilate to give a lepton pair. A brief description of hadron structure and the parton model is given to provide a necessary background. Then the general features of lepton pair production are described and the Drell-Yan formalism is set up. Experimental techniques are described next; these are rather simple since it is only necessary to detect the leptons emitted from hadron interactions. Predictions and tests of the basic model show that, in general, it works well. The anomalous features are the overall cross-section level (high by a factor of 2) and the unexpectedly large mean transverse momenta. Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) offers the explanation of these anomalies, and measurements of dilepton production provide important quantitative tests of QCD. Such measurements have also been used to determine nucleon structure functions and, for the first time, meson structure functions.}

  abstract={The LHC is delivering collision data since November 2009 up to a 7 TeV center of mass energy world record. The ATLAS experiment has collected more than 1 nb â1 collision data until the end of April 2010. The ATLAS Liquid Argon (LAr) calorimeter system, operational since August 2006, has been carefully commissioned and checked using collision data as well as single beam data and cosmic data taken previously. This paper gives an overview of the ATLAS LAr calorimeters status and performance up to the latest 7 TeV collision data. Results on the LAr calorimeters high voltage, LAr temperature, purity and readout electronic stability as well as results on timing alignments and early collision performances are shown here. All indicates that the ATLAS LAr calorimeter system is well commissioned and shows good and promising performances for the physics at LHC era.}

  abstract={The track reconstruction of modern high energy physics experiments is a very complex task that puts stringent requirements onto the software realisation. The ATLAS track reconstruction software has been in the past dominated by a collection of individual packages, each of which incorporating a different intrinsic event data model, different data flow sequences and calibration data. Recently, the ATLAS track reconstruction has undergone a major design revolution to ensure maintainability during the long lifetime of the ATLAS experiment and the flexibility needed for the startup phase. The entire software chain has been re-organised in modular components and a common event data model has been deployed. A complete new track reconstruction that concentrates on common tools aimed to be used by both ATLAS tracking devices, the Inner Detector and the Muon System, has been established. It has been already used during many large scale tests with data from Monte Carlo simulation and from detector commissioning projects such as the combined test beam 2004 and cosmic ray events. This document concentrates on the technical and conceptual details of the newly developed track reconstruction.}

  abstract={In the harsh environment of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN (design luminosity of 10 34 cm -2 s -1 ) efficient reconstruction of the signal primary vertex is crucial for many physics analyses. Described in this paper are primary vertex reconstruction strategies implemented in the ATLAS software framework Athena. The implementation of the algorithms follows a very modular design based on object oriented C++ and the use of abstract interfaces. This guarantees the easy use and exchange of different vertex fitters and finders which are considered for a given analysis. Such a modular approach relies on a dedicated Event Data Model for vertex reconstruction. The data model has been developed alongside the reconstruction algorithms. Its design is presented in detail. The performance of the implemented primary vertex reconstruction algorithms has been studied on a variety of Monte Carlo samples and results are presented.}

  abstract={The Pythia program can be used to generate high-energy-physics `events', i.e. sets of outgoing particles produced in the interactions between two incoming particles. The objective is to provide as accurate as possible a representation of event properties in a wide range of reactions, within and beyond the Standard Model, with emphasis on those where strong interactions play a rôle, directly or indirectly, and therefore multihadronic final states are produced. The physics is then not understood well enough to give an exact description; instead the program has to be based on a combination of analytical results and various QCD-based models. This physics input is summarized here, for areas such as hard subprocesses, initial- and final-state parton showers, underlying events and beam remnants, fragmentation and decays, and much more. Furthermore, extensive information is provided on all program elements: subroutines and functions, switches and parameters, and particle and process data. This should allow the user to tailor the generation task to the topics of interest. The code and further information may be found on the Pythia web page: http://www.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html [http://www.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html] .}
