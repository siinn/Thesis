\section{Background estimation}
\label{sec:dihiggs_backgrounds}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the present analysis we expect that at the end of the selection the
sample will be largely dominated by $t \bar{t}$ background, therefore the $t\bar{t}$ background normalisation
is derived from data. As described in Sec. \ref{sec:multijet}, the multi-jet
background is derived using the data-driven matrix method.
For all other backgrounds, e.g. di-boson, Higgs, $W$+jets, the
MC is used appropriately normalised using the expected cross sections and the
integrated luminosity that has been collected.

\subsection{Top normalisation and control region}
\label{subsec:topCR}
The top background is the major background source in this analysis,
therefore dedicated control regions (CR) are used to check its modeling
and to normalise it. Two CR's are defined, one for the SR's optimised for
the $m_h = 700$ GeV signal hypothesis (low mass analysis
in the following) and the other for the $m_h = 2000$ GeV signal (high mass
analysis in the following). The two CRs are defined in Table \ref{tab:CRdef}.

\begin{table}
\caption{Definition of the kinematic regions used to normalise the Top background.} \label{tab:CRdef}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{c}{Top CR definitions} \\
\hline
low mass &  ($m_{bb} < 100$ GeV or $m_{bb} > 140$ GeV ) and $p_T^{\rm bb} > 150$ GeV \\
high mass &   ({$m_{bb} < 100$ GeV or $m_{bb} > 140$}) and $p_T^{\rm bb} > 350$ GeV \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}


Table \ref{tab:CR1} and \ref{tab:CR2} show the number of observed
events and expected background events in the top CR. 

\begin{table}
\caption{Data and expected background yields in the low mass control
  region. NF of 1.12 has been applied to $t\bar{t}$ background.} \label{tab:CR1}
\input{chapters/dihiggs/tables/Yields_CR1.tex}
\end{table}

\begin{table}
\caption{Data and expected background yields in the high mass control
  region. NF of 1.05 has been applied to $t\bar{t}$ background.} \label{tab:CR2}
\input{chapters/dihiggs/tables/Yields_CR2.tex}
\end{table}


The top normalisation factors are determined by a simultaneous fit  of
signal and control regions. It also depends slightly on the $m_{hh}$ window due to the presence of top background in the signal region, and it is furthermore different for the \emph{low  mass} and \emph{high mass} analyses. The normalisation
factors of the two top control regions are shown in Table \ref{tab:NFs}.
\begin{table}
\caption{Normalisation factors for the two CRs, the statistical error
  includes only data statistics, the systematic error is shown to
  check the compatibility of the NF with one, but it is not directly
  used in the fit procedure.} \label{tab:NFs}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
\multicolumn{4}{c}{Top background normalisation factors in the two
  CRs} \\
\hline
region & NF & $\sigma_{stat.}$ & $\sigma_{syst.}$ \\
\hline
low mass & 1.12 & 0.005 & 0.21 \\
high mass & 1.05 & 0.03 & 0.36 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:CR1} and \ref{tab:CR2} show the number of observed
events and expected background events in the top CR after the
normalisation factors have been applied to the top background sample.

Fig.~\ref{fig:mbb_mhh} shows the $m_{bb}$ and $m_{hh}$ distributions in the two CRs while n Appendix \ref{app:CR1} and \ref{app:CR2} we show the complete distributions of the
relevant variables used in the analysis selection in the top CR.
