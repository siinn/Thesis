In this note, we present a search for Higgs boson pair production in the
$bbWW$ final state at $\sqrt{s} = 13 \tev$ with the ATLAS detector using
a total integrated luminosity of 13.3~fb$^{-1}$.
The expected upper limit at 95\% CL on the cross-section of
resonant production as a function of mass is shown in
Figure ~\ref{fig:finalLimit}. 
The most stringent limit is observed (expected) for a resonant mass of
$\sim$900 (900) GeV at $\sim$0.9 (0.6) pb. As fas as we know, this is the first result on the $hh$ production in the $bbWW$ channel in the single-lepton channel.
