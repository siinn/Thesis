\section{2-D Helicity Fraction Correlations}
\label{app:fractionCorrelations}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This appendix contains the results of a study focusing on the 2-D correlations between extracted helicity fractions. In the leptonic channel (Figure~\ref{fig:leptonic2Dcorrelation}), \fo is strongly anti-correlated with both \fl and \fr, and \fl and \fr are positively correlated. In the hadronic channel (Figure~\ref{fig:hadronic2Dcorrelation}), the lower separation between the templates w.r.t. the leptonic channel can be seen in the anti-correlations between \fo and both \fl and \fr. Both pairings are still anti-correlated but to a much smaller degree than in the leptonic channel. Additionally, the low separation between the left-handed and right-handed templates leads to a strong anti-correlation between \fl and \fr. The sensitivity of the combined leptonic+hadronic measurement (Figure~\ref{fig:lephad2Dcorrelation}) is driven by the leptonic sensitivity, and this can be seen from the identical correlation/anti-correlation patterns between helicity fractions in the leptonic and leptonic+hadronic measurements. The effect of adding the hadronic channel is to lessen the degree of correlation/anti-correlation in each pairing of the combination.
