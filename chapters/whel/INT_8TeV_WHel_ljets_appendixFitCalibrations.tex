\section{Calibration Curves and Pull Distribution}
\label{app:fitCalibrations}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This appendix contains the full calibration curves and pull distributions for the leptonic and hadronic measurements in the combined electron+muon, 1 exclusive + 2 inclusive \bt tag region. To create the curves, the left-handed, right-handed, and longitudinal templates are added together in user-defined quantities, 5000 sets of pseudo-data are generated using Poisson statistics to vary the nominal sum, and helicity fractions are extracted from the resulting histograms. A linear fit to the results returning a slope of one and an offset of zero is evidence of closure in the fitting procedure. Additionally, proper closure in the extraction of the right-handed fraction over a large range rovides good evidence that the u/d separation reconstruction does not bias the helicity fraction.
