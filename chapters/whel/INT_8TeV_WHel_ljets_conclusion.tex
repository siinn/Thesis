A measurement of the polarization of the \w bosons in semileptonic \ttbar decays has been performed using 20.2 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected with the ATLAS detector in 2012.


This analysis represents the first measurement of the \w boson polarization fractions using a dedicated up and down type quark separation for the hadronic analyser.
%\fo$= 0.690 \pm 0.026$, \fl$= 0.305 \pm 0.020$, and \fr$= 0.005 \pm 0.022$
The final measured helicity fractions were obtained in a number of regions combingind different \bt tag regions, lepton flavors, and measurements from both the leptonically and hadronically decaying \w's in the \ttbar decay chain. The most precise fractions, obtained from the fit to the reconstructed $\cos\theta^*$ distributions in the two inclusive \bt tag region of the leptonic analyser, are \fo$= 0.709 \pm 0.012$ (stat.+bkg.) $\pm 0.015$ (syst.), \fl$= 0.299 \pm 0.008$ (stat.+bkg.) $\pm 0.013$ (syst.), \fr$= -0.008 \pm 0.006$ (stat.+nkg.) $\pm 0.012$ (syst).

The results are in agreement with the NNLO predictions of the Standard Model and represent the most sensitive determination to date made using semileptonic \ttbar decays. Limits on anomalous couplings of the \Wtb\ vertex were set and good agreement with the Standard Model was observed. 


 %The fractions obtained in the leptonic, two inclusive \bt tag region are \fo$= 0.709 \pm 0.012$ \stat $\pm 0.022$ \syst, \fl$= 0.299 \pm 0.008$ \stat $\pm 0.011$ \syst, \fr$= -0.008 \pm 0.006$ \stat $\pm 0.019$ \syst. Both sets of results are in agreement with the NNLO QCD predictions, and the leptonic, two inclusive \bt tag results represent the most sensitive determination to date made using semileptonic \ttbar decays. Additionaly, the fully combined results represent the first ever direct determination of the helicity fractions using hadronically decaying \w bosons. Limits on anomalous couplings of the \Wtb\ vertex were set and good agreement with the Standard Model was observed.
