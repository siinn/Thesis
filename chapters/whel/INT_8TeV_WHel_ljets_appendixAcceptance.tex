This appendix contains a summary of studies done to understand the acceptance effects on the $\cos\theta^*$ distrubtion after event selection and reconstruction. For events in the leptonic channel with $\cos\theta^*$ ~ -1 (where lepton and b-jet are in parallel), some events fail event selection due to the \pt and isolation requirements of lepton and b-jet. This affects the leptonic side more than the hadronic side since the lepton-jet isolation requirement is not applied between jets. This behavior is visible in the plots. For events with $\cos\theta^*$ ~ +1, the neutrino (up-type quark) and b-jet are parallel and the neutrino (up-type quark) is emitted backward w.r.t the mother \w (unlike the preferred neutrino (up-type quark) emission direction due to V-A structure of W boson). In these cases, the MET cut in the one exclusive region rejects events and causes a relative depletion of events. This can be seen by comparing the corresponding leptonic plots (one exclusive vs two inclusive), but this effect is negligible on the hadronic side since any MET cut should be relatively uncorrelated with the selection of light jets.
